# Regex-Templates
Regex Templates created by Patryk 'UltiPro' WÃ³jtowicz using Regex.

The repository contains regex templates in order to collect them in one place and demonstrate their use.

# Usage

In each file, there is a regex and examples with descriptions. To use a regular expression for an entire single string, use at the beginning "^" and at the end "$". Example:

> ^[a-zA-Z]\w{2,15}$

Otherwise:

> [a-zA-Z]\w{2,15}
